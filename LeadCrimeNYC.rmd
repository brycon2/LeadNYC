Crime data comes from the New York Police Department's historical data website [@NewYorkPoliceDepartment2022]. 

Lead data comes from the New York City Environmental Health and Data Portal [@TheCityofNewYork2022].

Population data comes from U.S. Census estimates through the Census API system [@CensusAPI].
Information for the API can be found [here](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/popest-popproj/popest.Vintage_2021.html) and information for its variables can be found [here](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/popest-popproj/popest/popest-vars.Vintage_2013.html). County and state numbers can be found [here](https://www.census.gov/library/reference/code-lists/ansi.html).

## Results and Discussion

### Lead Accumulation Over Time

```{r, lead-visualization}
lead_borough_df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = `Rate BLL >=5 Âµg/dL (per 1,000 tested)`, color = Borough,group = Borough)) + 
  geom_point(size = 2)+
  geom_line()+
  theme_bw() + 
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1")
```

### Crime Change Over Time
```{r, crime-visualization, fig.show = "hold"}
major_felony_borough_pop_df %>%
  filter(Group == 1) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = PerCapita, color = Borough)) + 
  facet_grid(vars(Crime), scales = "free") + 
  geom_point()+
  theme_bw() + 
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1") 
major_felony_borough_pop_df %>%
  filter(Group == 2) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = PerCapita, color = Borough)) + 
  facet_grid(vars(Crime), scales = "free") + 
  geom_point()+
  theme_bw() + 
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1") + 
  ylab("Crimes Committed per 100,000 People")

```

### Granger-Causality Test

## Conclusion

- result summary
- next steps:
  - go down to a smaller level
  - include data on covariants:
    - economic data
    - general health factors
