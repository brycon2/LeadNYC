Name:Children under 6 years with elevated blood lead levels (BLL),Measure:Number Tested,How Calculated:Children under 6 years of age tested for lead poisoning in a given year. Children may be tested multiple times in a given year but are only counted once. All children are counted regardless of blood specimen type (confirmed or unconfirmed); the number is rounded to the nearest 100. <a href="http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/EPHTPDF/Childhood_Lead_Exposure_Definitions_June_2016.pdf" target="_blank">Read more </a>about different measures used by the Health Department for surveillance of childhood lead poisoning.,Source(s):New York City Healthy Homes Pr,Year:2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019,
Name:Children under 6 years with elevated blood lead levels (BLL),Measure:Number BLL >=5 µg/dL,How Calculated:Number of children less than 6 years old tested in a given year with blood lead levels of 5 mcg/dL or greater. The numbers in this table include all children tested within a given calendar year regardless of whether they were tested in previous years with the same or different blood lead levels. While children can receive more than one test during the calendar year children are only counted once using the highest confirmed blood lead level during the calendar year. If the child does not have a confirmed test in a given year the child’s blood lead level is based on the highest capillary or unknown test type. This measure differs from the number of children newly identified with blood lead levels at or above a certain level reported by the Health Department in other publications. <a href="http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/EPHTPDF/Childhood_Lead_Exposure_Definitions_June_2016.pdf" target="_blank">Read more </a>about different measures used by the Health Department for surveillance of childhood lead poisoning.,Source(s):New York City Healthy Homes Pr,Year:2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019,
